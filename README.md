# 💣♟️ Hazard Chess  

A daring combination of **Chess** and **Minesweeper** – where strategy and luck go hand in hand.


## 🕹️ Rules of the Game  

- The game still follows the **rules of chess**.
- On the board, many squares are planted with **hidden bombs**.
- **Going to the square with the bomb** → that chess piece **explodes and disappears**.
- **Some safe squares** will display numbers (like Minesweeper) → indicating how many bombs are around.

🎯 **Target**:  
- Defeat the opposing king **before you explode yourself**.


## 🖱️ Controls  

- **Left click** → select and move the chess piece.
- **Right click** → place a flag (mark a suspected bomb).
- **Double click** on the chess piece (or move the chess piece to a quick-open eligible square) → automatically flip the surrounding squares if you have placed enough correct flags.
